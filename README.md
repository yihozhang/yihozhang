### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Washington, Seattle. I have a vision of new programming tools that apply a mixture of modern techniques from metaprogramming, superoptimization, program synthesis, type systems, and more. To get a sense of it, some of my past (and current) projects involve knowledge of staging and partial evaluation, equality saturation, programming-by-example, solver-aided programming, and dependent type theory.
