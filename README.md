### Hi there 👋

I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Washington, Seattle. I'm interested in programming languages and its applications in various domains, including databases and systems.

**I'm looking for summer research interns for 2021.**

- Research keywords: Program Synthesis, SMT solver, Datalog, Staged Programming.
- Language keywords: Scala, OCaml, Haskell, Rust, Julia, Coq, Java, C.
- Interested but (currently) not on my research agenda: continuations and effects, design and implementation of type systems, advanced type theory (DT, HoTT, etc.), virtual machine.
- Beautiful ideas in programming languages: definitional interpreter, abstract machine, monads, theorems for free, CPS, Futamura projection, homoiconicity, logic programming, ...
- Previous projects
  - Hatafun: Embedding the type system of Datafun (ICFP 2016) in Haskell.
  - Sdl: Staged Datalog compiler using Lightweight Modular Staging.
  - Cornelius: Killing equivalent and redundant mutants with E-graph.
  - Sager: Demonic Graph Synthesizer for Worst-Case Performance, built with Rosette.
