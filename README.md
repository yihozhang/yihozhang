### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a PhD at the University of Washington, Seattle. I have a vision of new programming tools that apply a mixture of modern techniques from metaprogramming, superoptimization, program synthesis, type systems, and more. Some of my past (and current) projects explore various areas like staging, equality saturation, programming-by-example, solver-aided programming, and some type theories.
