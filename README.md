### Hi there 👋

I am a fourth-year PhD student studying Computer Science at UW Seattle, co-advised by Zachary Tatlock and Dan Suciu. I am broadly interested in the theories and applications of programming languages and data management.

My research centers loosely on the topic of domain-specific program optimization. This includes

* building hammers: I work on [theoretical foundations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02413) and [system building](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog) of Equality Saturation (EqSat), a technique called for domain-specific program optimization; and
* finding nails: I apply various techniques (like EqSat) to domains such as [web automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03705), [specialized hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02371), and [computational fabrication](https://github.com/yihozhang/szalinski/tree/cse556).
