### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a third-year PhD student studying Computer Science at UW Seattle, co-advised by Zachary Tatlock and Dan Suciu. I am broadly interested in the theories and applications of programming languages and data management.

Currently, I am working on a program optimization technique called Equality Saturation (EqSat):

* Theory: I try to answer questions like "when does EqSat terminate?".
* System: I am working on a new system called egglog that unifies Datalog and EqSat.
* Technique: I am interested in techniques that make EqSat better. In our POPL 2022 paper we made pattern matching in EqSat asymptotically faster.
* Application: I am always looking to apply EqSat to emerging domains, such as computational fabrication. I am maintaining a list of projects that use equality saturation.
